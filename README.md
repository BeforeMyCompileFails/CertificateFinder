# CertificateFinder
Certificate Finder is a Windows batch tool that scans an offline or dead system’s drive for certificates, private keys, and related cryptographic files. It preserves folder structure, copies Firefox and Windows crypto data, and generates a CSV manifest with SHA256 hashes for verification — making it ideal for IT admins and forensic recovery.
